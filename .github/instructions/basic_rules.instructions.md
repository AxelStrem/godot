Use correct PowerShell syntax for all terminal commands. Don't use && to chain commands together.

Don't wait for 'git commit' to output anything to the terminal. Instead proceed immediately after running the command.

When writing code, follow these basic rules:

1. **Project Structure**: Understand the overall structure of the Godot project, including key directories and files.
2. **Coding Standards**: Follow established coding conventions and best practices for the Godot engine.
3. **Documentation**: Refer to existing documentation for guidance on API usage and project-specific details.
4. **Testing**: Ensure that any code changes are accompanied by appropriate tests and that they pass all existing tests.
5. **Performance**: Consider the performance implications of code changes, especially in performance-critical areas.
6. **Collaboration**: Feel free to ask for help or clarification if you're unsure about any activity or requirement.
